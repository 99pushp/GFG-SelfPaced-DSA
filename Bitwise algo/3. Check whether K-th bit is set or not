3. Check whether K-th bit is set or not
class Solution
{
    public:
    bool checkKthBit(int n, int k){
        n=n>>k;
        if ((n&1)==0){
            return 0;
        }
        return 1;
    
// Your code here
// It can be a one liner logic!! Think of it!!
//Input: N = 500, K = 3
//Output: No
//Explanation: Binary representation of 500 is 
//111110100, in which 3rd bit from LSB is not set. 
//So, return false
//right shift by k and and with 1:
//if result is zero return false (0)
//if result is one return true (1)
    }
};
